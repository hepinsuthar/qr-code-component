# Frontend Mentor - QR code component solution

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

This is my solution to the [QR code component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H). I built this using basic HTML and CSS as a beginner-friendly practice to sharpen layout, styling, and responsiveness skills.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

While working on this project, I improved my understanding of:

- How to structure HTML semantically
- Using Flexbox for layout and centering
- Creating a clean and responsive component from a static design

Hereâ€™s an example of CSS I used to center the component:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
  font-family: 'Outfit', sans-serif;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
