# Front-end Style Guide – QR Code Component Solution

This is the style guide used for building the QR Code Component challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/qr-code-component-iux_sIO_H).

## Layout

The component is designed with a mobile-first approach and adapts to different screen sizes using responsive techniques.

Design reference widths:

* Mobile: 375px
* Desktop: 1440px

> ✅ The layout was built to be fully responsive and tested across a range of screen sizes (from 320px to 1440px+).

## Colors Used

These colors match the design as closely as possible:

* **Background color (light gray)**: hsl(212, 45%, 89%)
* **Card background (white)**: hsl(0, 0%, 100%)
* **Heading (dark blue)**: hsl(218, 44%, 22%)
* **Paragraph text (grayish blue)**: hsl(216, 15%, 48%)

## Typography

### Base text

* Font size: `15px` for body copy

### Font family

* **Font weights**: 400 (regular), 700 (bold)

## Notes
