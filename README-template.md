## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project helped me practice structuring HTML properly and using Flexbox to align and center content both vertically and horizontally. I also followed a design closely, which improved my attention to layout detail.

Example of CSS centering I used:

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  min-height: 100vh;
  background-color: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
}
